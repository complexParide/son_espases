# Predicting the number of incoming patients in the ED of the Son Espases University Hospital (HUSE)

This repository contains the datasets and code to predict the number of incoming patients to Son Espases' emergency department (ED). The data and methods are fully described in the paper *"Forecasting emergency department visits in the reference hospital of the Balearic Islands: the role of tourist and weather data"* by Crisafulli et al. The files contained are the following:

- The jupyter notebook used to obtain the results, plots, and tables.
- The dataset from the hospital of Son Espases that covers all the entries from December 26th 2015 to December 31st 2022. The version uploaded is not the raw one but a clean and aggregated version. The dataset is split into the following files: *Y_train.csv* (training dataset), *Y_validation.csv* (validation dataset), *Y_test.csv* (test dataset), and *Y_post-covid.csv* (post-COVID dataset). Additional details can be found in the paper.
- The dataset of exogenous variables, containing daily information about calendar, population (resident and tourist), and weather forecasts. This is the clean and one-hot encoded version. The dataset is split into the following files: *X_train.csv* (training dataset), *X_validation.csv* (validation dataset), *X_test.csv* (test dataset), and *X_post-covid.csv* (post-COVID dataset). Additional details can be found in the paper.
